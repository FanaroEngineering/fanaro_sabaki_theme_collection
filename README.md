# Fanaro Sabaki Theme Collection

Some more variants and themes for having a more lively Go experience.

Unexpectedly, having a dark goban is actually refreshing. Even though we don't see the lines as easily, it becomes clear that they are not that necessary, as most of the time we place stones relative to one another. Not having to pay that much attention to lines is quite liberating and leaves a cleaner design. However, it is true that neon/oversaturated colors can tire the eyes much more easily; in that case, choose a dark theme with less saturated colors.

Some of my inspirations are:

- The [Dracula &mdash; or Darcula &mdash;](https://draculatheme.com/) text editing theme.
- The [Color Go Server (CGS)](https://colorgoserver.com/).
    - Maybe someone could extract the theme goodness they have there?
